## Greetings! My name is Kylee, I'm an open-source developer advocate 👋

**I specialize in bridging the gap between code + community. 🤝**

Since 2021, my work has cultivated innovative communities, sustainable programs, and technical solutions for open-source startups and non-profits. 🌎

My greatest motivators? Empowering developers to build, designing problem-solving systems, connecting people, and the joy of coding from dark mode terminals. 🌙
