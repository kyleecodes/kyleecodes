## Welcome to my corner of GitHub 🌐

**My name is Kylee, and I bridge the gap between community + code. 🌐**

Since 2021, my work has cultivated innovative digital communities, sustainable programs, and technical solutions for open-source startups and tech non-profits. #techforgood 🌱

I specialize in enabling developers to build + designing systems to solve developer's problems. This can look like content creation, evangelism, technical writing, and developing helpful internal tools. 👩‍💻
