## Welcome to my corner of GitHub 🌐

**My name is Kylee, and I bridge the gap between community + code.**

I'm an open-source developer advocate and community builder from the East Coast of the United States. 🌎

Since 2021, my work has cultivated innovative communities, sustainable programs, and technical solutions for open-source startups and non-profits. #techforgood 

I specialize in enabling developers to build, and designing systems to solve-problems. Most days, you can find me coding from dark mode terminals. 🌙
